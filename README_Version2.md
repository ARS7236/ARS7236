# Hi there 👋

Welcome — this repo is a collection of my experiments, small projects, and anything I didn't know where to put. Mostly vibecoding: for fun, boredom, or both `¯\_(ツ)_/¯`

## About me

--- /code: ---
`I'm vibecoding stuff for fun, boredom, or both, and I use ChatGPT and the Gemini agent in VS Code for idea polishing.`

## What’s in this repo
This repo contains miscellaneous projects and unnamed experiments. Each folder is a small project or a sandbox. Expect variety — prototypes, scripts, demos, and sometimes just notes.

## Projects
- Project folders are in the root — browse each directory to see what’s inside.
- If you want a tour of a specific project, open an issue or ping me.

## Links & social
- YouTube: [ARS7236](https://www.youtube.com/@ARS7236) — all links and videos are there.

## Want to collaborate?
Open an issue or drop a message on YouTube. I’m usually open to ideas.

Also — I love bananas (fruit, not the game on Steam) 🍌
